# LED displays #

When AIRSTART = 0, the red, blue and yellow LEDs will flash while the IMU is calibrating at startup.

ArduIMU Indicator LEDs (after startup):

  * Green LED = Power On
  * Yellow LED = Indicates that the speed filter is supressing yaw drift correction. You should see it on if you are not in motion above the set threshold speed.
  * Red LED = On after calibration
